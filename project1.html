                  <p class="section-paragraphs"> A client came to us with the problem that the cloud storage and organization platform is a fast growing marketplace. From Google Drive to Evernote, each digital note taking and syncing service offers a variety of convenient features to enhance productivity and to keep content stored and accessible at any time. However, sometimes these platforms are not intuitive and lack in some important features i.e. the ability to categorize content and/or view previews of files. </p>

                  <h2 class="section-title"> Solution </h2>

                  <p class="section-paragraphs">Overall, there was no clear pattern in the data that suggested users were unhappy with their current mediums of cloud-sharing. So the challenge that was presented was to focus on the main important points from the survey and build upon that.
